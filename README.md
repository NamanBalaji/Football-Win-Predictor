# Football-Win-Predictor
Machine learning models to predict the winner of a football game.

<p>This machine learning project is made using a dataset obtained from kaggle.</p>
 The data set can be obtained from the given link.<a>https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer</a>
 This datset contains records of european club fixtures played between the year 2008 and 2016.
 I have trained three models Logistic regreesion, Support vector machine and random forest.
 Note that i was not able to upload the rzndom forest model as the file size was too large.
 All these modles have nearly the same accuracy ranging between 52% to 53%.Considering the unpredictable nature of the game this is not thatt bad.
 Further improvements that can br made to this project:
     <ul>
        <li>Can be incorporated into  a website</li>
        <li>More ensemble modles like Xgboost can be trained</li>
  <li>Feature selection can be done in a diffrent way to check its impact on accuray</li>
  <li>Dataset can be updated with new fixtures to improve the modles even more.</li>
  </ul>
